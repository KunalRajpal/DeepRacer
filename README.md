## Reward Function

The reward function is a Python function named reward_function that takes a single argument params. 
This argument is a dictionary containing various parameters related to the vehicle's state and the track environment.

### Parameters

- **speed:**               The vehicle's current speed
- **all_wheels_on_track:** Boolean indicating if the vehicle has all wheels on the track
- **waypoints:**           List of points defining the track center. Each waypoint is a list of two coordinates [x, y]
- **closest_waypoints:**   Tuple of two integers representing the indices in waypoints of the two nearest waypoints
- **heading:**             The vehicle's heading in degrees between -180 and 180
- **steering_angle:**      The current steering angle in degrees

### Reward Calculation

- **Speed Reward:**      Encourages the vehicle to maintain a speed between a specified minimum (min_speed) and maximum (max_speed). The reward increases linearly with speed within this range
- **Off-Track Penalty:** A minimal reward is returned if all_wheels_on_track is False, penalizing the vehicle for going off-track
- **Heading Reward:**    Rewards the vehicle for aligning its heading with the direction of the track. The closer the vehicle's heading to the track direction, the higher the reward
- **Steering Reward:**   Rewards the vehicle for steering alignment with the direction difference. This encourages smoother turns
- **Progress Reward:**   Based on the progress parameter, which indicates how much of the track has been completed. This rewards the vehicle for moving forward along the track
- **Total Reward:**      The final reward is a sum of the speed, heading, steering, and progress rewards

### Reward Weights

- **speed_weight:**    Weight for the speed reward component
- **heading_weight:**  Weight for the heading reward component
- **steering_weight:** Weight for the steering reward component
- **progress_weight:** Weight for the progress reward component

### Additional Calculations

- **Track Direction Calculation:** Computes the direction of the track at the vehicle's current position.
- **Direction Difference:**        The absolute difference between the track direction and the vehicle's heading.
- **Steering Difference:**         The absolute difference between the steering angle and the direction difference.
